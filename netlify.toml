# Netlify Configuration for BrainImation
# This file controls how Netlify builds and deploys your site

  # By default, publish the root directory but docs will be excluded via ignore pattern

  # No build command needed since this is a static site
  command = "echo 'No build required for static site'"

# Ignore patterns - exclude documentation from deployment

# Ignore files and folders during deployment
# Note: Netlify doesn't have direct file exclusion, so we use .gitignore
# Create .gitignore if using Git deployment
